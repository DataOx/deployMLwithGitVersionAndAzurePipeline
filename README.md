This is an example using azure devops pipelines with git version to build and push images in an automated fashion.

We use pipenv to manage the virtual environment. To install the packages using pipenv, assuming that you have cloned the project locally, run 
pipenv install  requirement.txt

The virtual env will be created. You can see Pipfile and Pipefile.lock has been generated in your peoject root. 
To activate the virtual env, run 
pipenv shell
